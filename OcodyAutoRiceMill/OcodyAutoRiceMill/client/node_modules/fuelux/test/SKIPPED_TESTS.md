When the tree accessibility work was originally done, time did not allow for fully baking all of the unit tests. All of the reasonable test cases that I could think of were defined so that the intended functionality could be documented. The idea being that if the tree was ever touched again (which is actually a big question mark given the state of Fuel UX) any functionality affected by the re-work should at that time (if reasonable) be covered by fully-baked unit tests.
